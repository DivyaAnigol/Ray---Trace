### Description of the work
+ This Monte-Carlo model extends the earlier ray-tracing work by replacing deterministic rays with randomized emission sampling and converting every ray hit into real energy deposition. Unlike the previous codes, it performs full energy conservation, computes heat flux from ray-hit density, and predicts final temperature rise on the powder bed. This makes it the most physically realistic and complete ray-based thermal model.
