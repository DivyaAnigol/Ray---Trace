# Ray---Trace
This work marks the transition of my ray-tracing study from ANSYS to MATLAB, using a fully custom heater-configuration model built from scratch. By recreating the geometry and control logic in MATLAB, the project now offers faster iteration, deeper customization, and a more flexible platform for analysing IR heater behaviour.
