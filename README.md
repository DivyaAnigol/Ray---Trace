### Description of the work
+ The script demonstrates the concept of IR heater radiation and powder-bed heating, but it remains a simplified model. It does not include full radiative physics, spectral heating, view factors, reflections, or temperature-dependent material behavior, so the results are useful for visualization but not fully realistic.
+  By changing the PWM values, the shift in flux mapping can be observed.
+  By clicking on the map, the temperature value at that position could be read.
